## About Ohmyfood

Ohmyfood is an online food ordering company that allows user to compose their own menu and reduce waiting time in restaurants because they make their choice in advance.

## Compatibility

The site has been developed using mobile-first approach. As part of this project, I was provided with the mobile mock up, and for the tablet and desktop version I defined the layout.
This project uses HTML and CSS using Sass. One of the main parts of this project is using animations and transitions to show specific behaviour such as a loading spinner, menu cards being presented and selecting dishes to give feedback to the users.

## Deliverables

Homepage (x1) - Displaying location, brief description of the company and cards of restaurants <br>
Menu pages (x4) - Dishes appear gradually with a slight time lag and an animation shows when selecting each dish <br>
Footer - identical on all pages <br>
Header - present on all pages <br>
Graphic effects and animations using CSS animations or transitions <br>
Buttons - showing drop shadows and changing color - heart-shaped Like button with effect <br>
